# CS574_NLP

KAIST CS574 Natural Language Processing 1 course project

## Project Summary (First Proposal - Brain-Storming) : 3/23

#### What to Submit?

- ##### Team Details
	- Team Name: A short, memorable name
	- Members: Names and IDs of all the group members
	- Division of Labor: In a single sentence for each member, describe the relavant background, and the part of the project are they likely to contribute to.
	- Diversity: Add a single sentence to describe what you think makes your group diverse.
	- If there have been any changes in the team (individual or the team name), please highlight it (for example, in red color).
- ##### Problem Setup and Motivation
	- Describe the problem that your contribution will be addressing. 
		- This should include, at the very least, what the formal problem set up is (what is the input and the output?) and 
		- why is it important (potential applications?). 
	- A brief understanding of related work should be included to support your project, such as the similar tasks that have been studied in the literature so far: through descriptions and citations to the related works (you can include a separate related work section). 
		- The reference section is not included in the 2-page maximum

- ##### Proposed Approach
	- Describe what strategy you envision taking to solve the problem you proposed above. 
		- (In the first summary)
			- Not to need a detailed solution, but instead a very high-level understanding of how you intend to bridge the gap between the input and the expected outputs. 
			- It can be changed considerably as you learn more about NLP and your project, however this section is where you will argue why it is an achievable goal for the semester. 
		- (In the proposal)
			- Give more details about the approach that you are proposing, including what makes it different from existing approaches to your problem, if any.
			- Mention the potential issues you are likely to face, i.e. scalability, lack of labeled data, etc. and how you plan to address them. 

- ##### Evaluation Plan
	- Describe how you intend to evaluate whether your project was successful. 
		- Although you may include a brief description of the qualitative results (such as examples, important features, etc.), 
		- focus on empirical evaluation. 
			- What is the dataset you will evaluate on? 
			- If you do not have any, how will you collect it? 
			- What is the evaluation metric? 
			- What is the baseline you definitely want to beat, or alternatively, what is the performance you would be happy with (e.g. > 80% accuracy)? 
	- Give details of the specific dataset/plan you have identified for evaluation. 
	- Describe the metrics you will use to test the success of your project at the end of the semester. 
	- Given that this is the most important aspect of the project, you should have ***definitely*** decided both of these by now. 

- ##### Plan of Work
	- Provide a rough outline of the major milestones of the project, and 
	- a rough estimate for when you estimate you will achieve it. 
	- In particular, include what you expect to have achieved by the mid-semester status report. 
	- If you have already made concrete progress on the project, other than what has been mentioned in the above sections, mention so in this section.

- ##### Tips and Suggestion
	- Play to your strengths
		- work on something you like doing, and have some expertise in, as much as possible. If you are a machine learner, think about what NLP tasks can your methods be applied to. If you have some problem you care about, propose a novel task or dataset for others to collaborate on. If you have some ongoing research that is relevant, identify a small, independent research question, and propose it. 
	- Skim papers
		- Go through the list of papers on the course. Read their abstracts, and see if any of them get you excited. Browse titles on recent NLP and ML conferences (ICML, NIPS, AAAI, ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, and KDD), see if you can find their datasets or codebases. For even more “niche” topics, look at conference workshops to see if you like something.
	- Use Github
		- Learn git , and use Github to share as much as possible with your group: reports, code, data, documentation, etc. 
		- Consider using other features like issues, website (Github Pages), and the wiki. 
		- Encourage you to make your repositories public for open source access (maybe use a license like Apache), but you are free to keep it private if you like (Github provides free private repos). 
		- Feel free to include the repo URL in the proposal if you decide to make it public, or want to share the private repo with me 
	- Use KLMS
		- Encourage you to continue using KLMS even after the teams are finalized, such as to compare your results to others working on the same/similar data, or to solicit feedback/suggestions from others on software libraries. 
	- ***Start work early***
